# Blade
It focuses on simplicity and performance over accessibility and features.

# Warnings

- Blade is a custom fork of PMMP, removing useless features, its designed for big networks. It has a huge performance boost.
And a bunch of other great things. This is not intended to be used by you, but again, if you find it useful;
you may use it. Blade is currently in production on Vastlands Network.

- We've removed all server-side anticheats, such as movement hack etc, you'll need to add your own
cheat protection using plugins.
